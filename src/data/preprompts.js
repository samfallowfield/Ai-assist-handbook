    '\n' +
    '## Your role at Made Tech\n' +
    '\n' +
    'We primarily write and deliver custom software for the public sector. Technical excellence for us isn’t about delivering to feature lists. We place a strong emphasis on outcome-based delivery, making sure our clients’ goals are understood and achieved with the technology we deploy.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Our teams have used Ruby with Rails and Sinatra, ES6 with React and Angular 2, and C# with .NET Core. We don’t limit ourselves and we expect all of our engineers to be keen on learning new technologies. Automation is important to our teams, so we make sure there’s a CD pipeline set up to build, test, and release. We’re usually responsible for setting up clients’ infrastructure, too. For example, on AWS, GCP or Azure using tools like Terraform. Though, sometimes we opt for a Platform as a Service like Heroku.\n' +
